# openHAB timeline picker v3

This project extends openHABs basicUI by a sitemap component to setup timebased processes. (e.g. heating control, light control, rollershutter)

In the component you can set and change intervals by mouse or touch and combine them with any switching states. An alias for each switching state is possible, which is displayed in the legend. (e.g. heating control: 23Â°C - alias: comfort). By combination with sunrise and sunset relative switching points are possible. The setup of the timeline picker is done by url parameters when calling it in the sitemap and/or in the setup of the timeline itself.
The second part is a rule, which actually does the switching. In the default configuration this rule is called in 2min intervals. This is the smallest value of a state change switching for sun position dependent processes. For switch events the smallest interval in the timeline is 15min.
The communication takes place via the REST- interface. When you have problems with CORS, add the following line in the file services/runtime.cfg: org.eclipse.smarthome.cors:enable=true

## Whats new in V3

There is a possibility to switch states depending on the position of sun. The installation of the widget is much easier. You must not define helper item and groups. The persistence setup is also obsolete. All adjustments are included in openHAB backups (values stored in JsonDB). The internal datastructur is much more flexible for further features.
In addition, a setup area is introduced with v3.

There is only support for javascript. (you will find older versions here in 'Get started')

## **Parameter and Examples**

## **headline for widget**

In the example below you can see a headline. This headline will displaedy inside the ui- widget. It's helpfull when you use multiple timelines on a single padge. The headline is optional.

### **events depending of position of the sun**

**Example for thursday:**

In the upper left you see the three icons for sun ignored, switch only when not sun and switch only when sun. The selection of this conditions is pretty simply. As first select you desired switch state and now you can select one of the three sun options. In the timeline you see additional icons and a yellow band for the sun releated interval.

* from 6am to 10am the state with alias xyz will only activated when sun rised
* when  at 6am the sun is not rised, the condition will be checked every 2 minutes
* when sun is rised in this intervall the state will be activated

![user interface](img/tlp_example3.PNG)

**activation:** Set the checkbox activate.

**offsets:** For both, sunrise and sunset you can define a separat offset. The offset is only valid for this single  timeline. It's not global in your installation.

## **alias for commands**

You can define an alais for each switch state. The linked icons to control will receive the state defined in the url.

## **admin area**

![admin](img/tlp_example1.PNG)

This area is an extra widget to set the item names for sunrise and sunset. Also you can remove existing timelines. Then you remove the last existing timeline all data created from the timelinepicker will be removed in jsonDB.

```openHAB
Frame label="timeline example admin" {
    Webview icon="none" url="/static/tlp-jsr/index.html?admin&token=oh.TimeLinePicker.xxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```
