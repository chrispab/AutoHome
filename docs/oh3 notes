a relative URL is enough. Example: “/static/image.png” .This also works remotely via myopenhab.org 7



To access the terminal for influxdb execute ./services/influxdb/terminal.sh. Here you can set additional parameters or create other databases.

command="SELECT value::integer INTO temp FROM measurement; DROP MEASUREMENT measurement; SELECT value::integer INTO measurement FROM temp; DROP MEASUREMENT temp;"

influx -database 'openhab' -execute "$(sed "s#measurement#$m#g" <<< $command)"


I must admit, I encountered the same problem and worked around it, instead of raising an issue. I changed the type of my historic data to integer by storing it to a temporary measurement:


docker exec -it influxdb influx

select value::integer into Flur_Bell_Lock2 from Flur_Bell_Lock
drop measurement Flur_Bell_Lock
select value::integer into Flur_Bell_Lock from Flur_Bell_Lock2


select value::integer into FR_Heater2 from FR_Heater
drop measurement FR_Heater
select value::integer into Zone3FanStatus from Zone3FanStatus2
drop measurement Zone3FanStatus2

Zone3VentSpeedStatus
