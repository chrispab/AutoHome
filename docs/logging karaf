Use the Karaf logging commands to enable debug logging for automation:
log:set DEBUG org.openhab.core.automation. Leave this on for setup and testing,
but you may want to set to WARN when everything is setup.
For older openHAB builds before the ESH reintegration (older than snapshot 1566 and 2.5M2), you will need to change this to org.eclipse.smarthome.automation.

Enable debug logging for jsr223: log:set DEBUG jsr223. This is the default logger used in the examples and the helper libraries.

log:set WARN org.openhab.core.automation
log:set DEBUG jsr223
