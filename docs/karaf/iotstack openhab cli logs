Connecting via SSH

The console can also be reached via a secure shell (SSH

(opens new window)) connection.

To reach the console using SSH, use the following command to connect to the localhost interface on TCP port 8101:

ssh -p 8101 openhab@localhost

Note

By default, connections are only allowed from localhost, i.e. only from the machine running openHAB. Connections are intentionally not allowed from remote hosts due to security concerns. To change this, see Bind Console to All Interfaces.

A security warning is expected upon the first connection:

The authenticity of host '[localhost]:8101 ([127.0.0.1]:8101)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:XjQxBPit+K5m3HuSsEUI/842NTCxLTu3EMGGBuQKNVg.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

Enter yes to proceed.

Warning: Permanently added '[localhost]:8101' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
