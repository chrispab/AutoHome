So you could start stop or restart it in a ssh connection with

sudo systemctl restart openhab.service
sudo systemctl stop openhab.service

userdata goes to /var/lib/openhab and conf goes to /etc/openhab.

You might want to clear out the userdata/cache and userdata/tmp folders but thatâ€™s probably not strictly necessary.

Just make sure that the new instance of OH is exactly the same as the version the configs are coming from. After the restore you can upgrade but not before.

sudo openhab-cli backup

Which places a file in /var/lib/openhab2/backups, which can then be restored using:

sudo openhab-cli restore /var/lib/openhab2/backups/filename.zip

This backs up both text config from /etc/openhab and PaperUI config from /var/lib/openhab/
