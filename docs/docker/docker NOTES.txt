starting your IOTstack¶

To start the stack:

$ cd ~/IOTstack
$ docker-compose up -d


stopping your IOTstack¶

Stopping aka "downing" the stack stops and deletes all containers, and removes the internal network:

$ cd ~/IOTstack
$ docker-compose down

To stop the stack without removing containers, run:

$ cd ~/IOTstack
$ docker-compose stop


updating images not built from Dockerfiles¶

If new versions of this type of image become available on DockerHub, your local IOTstack copies can be updated by a pull command:

$ cd ~/IOTstack
$ docker-compose pull
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker system prune

The pull downloads any new images. It does this without disrupting the running stack.

The up -d notices any newly-downloaded images, builds new containers, and swaps old-for-new. There is barely any downtime for affected containers.
