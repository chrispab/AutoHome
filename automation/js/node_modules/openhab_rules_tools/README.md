# openHAB Rules Tools
A collection of library functions, classes, rule templates, MainUI widgets, and examples to reuse in the development of new openHAB capabilities.

# Installation

## Libraries
Previously this library supported Jython libraries that only work with OH 2.x.
Those are still available in the `before-npm` branch but have been removed and are no longer maintained in main going forward.

Similarly, ECMAScript 5.1 versions of these libraries exist in the `before-npm` branch.
These too are removed from the main branch and are no longer maintained.

The libraries that will continue to be developed going forward will be JS Scripting, Blockly, and rule templates.
The JS Scripting libraries can be installed using npm.
Blockly libraries and rule templates can be installed from the openHAB marketplace.

## Rule Tempaltes
Rule templates are written in various languages.
Sometimes they will have dependencies that must be separately installed (other templates, libraries, add-ons).
See the readme and the docs for each template for more details.

Installation of a template can be done from MainUI under Settings -> Automation.

1. In MainUI go to Settings.
2. Open "Automation".
3. Browse for the rule template to install; you might need to click on "show all".
4. Read the description and instructions for how to use the template and make sure you understand it. Some tempaltes require you to first write another rule which the template rule will call or require tyhe creation of Items or addition of Item metadata, for example.
5. In the rule template and click "Add".
6. Now go to Settings -> Rules.
7. Click the + and enter the UID, label and description.
8. Choose the rule template from the list of installed templates.
9. Fill out the parameters and click Save.

# Prerequisites

## Rule Templates
- openHAB 3.2 M2+
- additional requirements in the docs for each

## Libraries
- openHAB 3.2 Release or later
- JavaScript Scripting add-on installed with the default configuration

# Tests
Many of the library capabilities also have "unit tests" located in the `test` folder.
Because of the dependency on the openHAB environment to run, these can be copied into a script rule and run manually.
Always watch the logs for errors or success.
This should only be required for those modifying the scripts and modules.

However, they are a good place to look at for examples for using various capabilities.

# Usage
For rule tempaltes, see the README.md file bundled with each rule template and the entry in the [Marketplace postings](https://community.openhab.org/c/marketplace/rule-templates/74).

The following sections describe the purpose of each library capability.
Be sure to look at the comments, the code, and the tests for further details on usage and details.

Name | Purpose 
-|-
`CountdownTimer` | Implements a timer that updates a `Number` or `Number:Timer` Item once a seconds with the amount of time remaining on that timer. This works great to see in the UI how much time is left on a timer.
`Deferred` | Allows one to easily schedule an update or command to be send to an Item in the future. It can be cancelled. This makes creating a timer for simple actions easier.
`Gatekeeper` | Schedules a sequence of actions with a time between one to the next. It can be used to limit how quickly commands are sent to a device or create a schedule of tasks (e.g. irrigation).
`LoopingTimer` | Creates a timer that loops until a condition is met. Pass in a function that returns how much time to schedule the next loop iteration or `null` when the timer should exit.
`RateLimit` | Implements a check that ignores an action if it occurs too soon after the previous action. This is good to limit how often one receives alerts or how often to process events like from a motion snesor. 
`timeUtils` | A collection of functions that convert and manipulate times and durations. Almost all the other library capabilities depend on this. `toDateTime` will convert almost any duration or date time to a `time.ZonedDateTime`.
`TimerMgr` | A class that provides book keeping and management of multiple timers (e.g. one timer per Item for a rule that handled multiple Items). It supports rescheduling, flapping detection, etc.
`testUtils` | A collection of functions useful for testing.
`groupUtils` | A collection of functions to simplify mapping and reducing members or descendents of a Group.
`rulesUtils` | A collection of function to simplify the creation of a rule triggered by Items with a given tag or given Item metadata. These do not work well in UI rules.

## How to Save an Instance Between Runs?
Most of the library capabilities above are classes that one instantiates and reuses over multiple executions of a given rule. 
So how does one save that instance so it doesn't get overwritten each time a rule runs?
There are two options.

### Cache
The openhab-js library includes a `cache` which is a place one can place variables that are shared across all rules and script actions/conditions.
This is the preferred way to both share variables between rules and to preserve data across multiple rule runs.
One can pull, and if the Object doesn't exist instantiate it and save it to the `cache` in one line inside your rule.

```
var timers = cache.get(ruleUID+'_tm', () => new timerMgr.TimerMgr());
```

Because the `cache` is shared across all rules, it's important to use unique keys or else one rule might overwrite a cached value from another one.

### Global Variable
If writing your rules in .js files, you can define a variable outside of your rules and that variable will be "global" to all the rules in that file.
That variable will also be preserved from one run of the rules to the next.

```
var tm = new timerMgr.TimerMgr();

...
    // inside a rule
    tm.check(key, '5m', runme);
```

NOTE: This approach is not possible in UI rules.
